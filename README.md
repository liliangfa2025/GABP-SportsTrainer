# 🧠 AI-Driven Sports Training Optimization with GABP Neural Network

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the application of a **GABP neural network**—an enhanced model that integrates **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** with the **Backpropagation (BP)** neural network—to revolutionize the effectiveness of sports training programs. Through the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, this system offers intelligent, personalized, and adaptive training solutions for athletes across various disciplines.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 **Hybrid GABP Neural Network**: Combines the global optimization capabilities of Genetic Algorithms with the adaptive learning of BP neural networks.
- 📊 **Data-Driven Training Evaluation**: Processes comprehensive input data (biometrics, training logs, performance stats) to assess and improve training effectiveness.
- 🎯 **Precision Optimization**: Identifies performance plateaus and prescribes intelligent adjustments to training routines.
- 🧬 **Enhanced Convergence**: Overcomes the limitations of conventional BP networks by avoiding local minima and improving training accuracy.
- 🧑‍🏫 **Personalized Coaching**: Supports individualized training strategies based on real-time data analytics and predictive modeling.

## 🧪 Experimental Results

Athletes who engaged with the AI-enhanced training protocols demonstrated:

- ✅ Faster improvement in key performance metrics.
- ✅ Higher training efficiency.
- ✅ Better adaptation to customized coaching regimes.

## 🧱 Technology Stack
